Updated Task 8: Configure an Application Gateway with a Backend Pool Using Windows 10 Pro
Since you prefer to use Windows 10 Pro for your tasks, the VMs in this task will use Windows 10 Pro instead of Windows Server. Here’s the updated task tailored to your requirements:

Objective
Set up an Azure Application Gateway to distribute HTTP traffic across two Windows 10 Pro virtual machines within a private network, using a private IP for load balancing and testing.

Steps to Complete Task 8
Step 1: Set Up the Network and VMs
Create a Virtual Network (VNet):

Go to Virtual Networks in the Azure Portal.
Click + Create and provide the following details:
Name: AppGatewayVNet
Address Space: 10.0.0.0/16
Subnet 1: AG-Subnet with address range 10.0.1.0/24
Subnet 2: VM-Subnet with address range 10.0.2.0/24
Click Review + create > Create.
Create Two Windows 10 Pro VMs in VM-Subnet:

Go to Virtual Machines and click + Create > Azure Virtual Machine.
Create two VMs:
VM1:
Name: VM1
OS: Windows 10 Pro
Region: Same as the VNet.
Size: Select the smallest size (e.g., B1s) for cost-efficiency.
Network Interface: Place it in VM-Subnet of AppGatewayVNet.
VM2: Repeat the same steps for the second VM.
Ensure no Public IP is assigned to either VM to maintain a private network setup.
Install a Web Server on Both VMs:

Connect to each VM using RDP (via Bastion or another VM in the same VNet).
Open PowerShell in each VM and run the following commands:
powershell
Copy code
Install-WindowsFeature -name Web-Server -IncludeManagementTools
echo "VM1 - App Gateway Test" > C:\inetpub\wwwroot\index.html
Replace "VM1" with "VM2" on the second VM.
Step 2: Create the Application Gateway
Go to Application Gateways in Azure Portal:

Click + Create and configure:
Name: MyAppGateway
Region: Same as your VNet and VMs.
Tier: Standard V2 (cost-efficient option).
Virtual network: AppGatewayVNet.
Subnet: Select AG-Subnet.
Configure Frontend IP:

Select Private IP.
Name the configuration PrivateFrontend.
Assign the Frontend IP to AG-Subnet.
Configure Backend Pool:

Name: MyBackendPool.
Add the private IPs of both VMs:
VM1: (e.g., 10.0.2.4).
VM2: (e.g., 10.0.2.5).
Set Up HTTP Settings:

Name: HTTPSettings
Backend Port: 80
Enable Use for host-based routing.
Leave other settings as default.
Define Listener and Routing Rules:

Listener:
Name: PrivateListener.
Listener Type: Private (using PrivateFrontend).
Routing Rule:
Name: DefaultRoutingRule.
Associate the rule with:
Listener: PrivateListener.
Backend Pool: MyBackendPool.
HTTP Settings: HTTPSettings.
Review and Create:

Validate the configuration and click Create.
Step 3: Test the Configuration
Retrieve the Application Gateway Private IP:

Go to Application Gateway > Frontend IP Configurations.
Note the private IP (e.g., 10.0.1.4).
Test Load Balancing from Another VM:

Deploy a lightweight VM in AG-Subnet for testing, using Windows 10 Pro.
Connect to the testing VM via RDP.
Open PowerShell and run:
powershell
Copy code
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://10.0.1.4"
The response should alternate between:
VM1 - App Gateway Test
VM2 - App Gateway Test
Verify Health Probes:

Go to Application Gateway > Backend health.
Confirm both VMs are marked as healthy.
Outcome
You’ve successfully set up an Application Gateway with a private IP to load balance traffic across two Windows 10 Pro VMs. This configuration keeps traffic within the private network while providing application-layer routing.

Let me know if you encounter any issues or need clarification!





















Since you're using Windows 10 Pro (not Windows Server), the Get-WindowsFeature command will not work because it is specific to Windows Server editions. In Windows 10, we need to use the Windows Optional Features for IIS installation.

Let me guide you through the process of checking and ensuring that IIS is installed properly on your Windows 10 Pro VM:

1. Install IIS on Windows 10 Pro
If IIS is not installed yet, follow these steps to install it:

Open PowerShell as Administrator:

Right-click the Start button and choose Windows PowerShell (Admin).
Install IIS: Run the following command to install IIS:

powershell
Copy code
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName IIS-WebServerRole -All -NoRestart
This will install the IIS Web Server feature.

Restart the VM (if necessary): After installation, restart your VM to apply the changes.

2. Verify IIS Installation
After installing IIS, follow these steps to verify the installation:

Check IIS Installation Status: Open Control Panel → Programs → Turn Windows features on or off.

In the list of Windows Features, look for Internet Information Services. Ensure that the Web Management Tools and World Wide Web Services options are checked. These should include IIS Management Console, Web Server (IIS), and Common HTTP Features.

3. Check IIS Service
Make sure the IIS service is running:

Press Win + R, type services.msc, and press Enter to open Services.
Locate the World Wide Web Publishing Service in the list.
Ensure that it is Running. If not, right-click it and select Start.
4. Create the Index File
Once IIS is installed and running, create the index.html file as a test page:

Open PowerShell again (or Command Prompt as Admin).

Run this command to create a test page for VM1:

powershell
Copy code
echo "VM1 - App Gateway Test" > C:\inetpub\wwwroot\index.html
For VM2, run a similar command but with different text to distinguish it:

powershell
Copy code
echo "VM2 - App Gateway Test" > C:\inetpub\wwwroot\index.html
5. Test IIS
From the VM itself: Open a browser on the VM and go to http://localhost. You should see the page with "VM1 - App Gateway Test" (for VM1) or "VM2 - App Gateway Test" (for VM2).

From another VM in the same network: Open a browser and try accessing the VM by its private IP (e.g., http://<VM_Private_IP>).

6. Check Firewall Settings
If you can't access IIS from another VM or external machine, check the Windows Firewall settings to ensure that HTTP traffic (port 80) is allowed:

Go to Control Panel → Windows Defender Firewall.
In the left-hand menu, click Advanced settings.
In Inbound Rules, ensure there's a rule that allows HTTP traffic (port 80). If it's missing, you can manually add a new rule.
Conclusion
By following these steps, you should be able to install and verify IIS on Windows 10 Pro. If everything is working correctly, you'll be able to access the default web page at http://localhost or the VM’s private IP. If it’s still not working, we can further investigate the specific issue.
