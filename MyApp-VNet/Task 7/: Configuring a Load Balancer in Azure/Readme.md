Task 7: Configuring a Load Balancer in Azure
Objective: Set up an Azure Load Balancer to distribute traffic across multiple VMs for high availability and reliability.

Step-by-Step Instructions:
Step 1: Create Virtual Machines for Backend Pool
Create Two Virtual Machines:
Go to Virtual Machines in the Azure portal.
Click + Create to create two Windows Server VMs. These VMs will be added to the backend pool of the load balancer.
Ensure both VMs are in the same Virtual Network and subnet.
Assign them static private IPs (optional but recommended for consistency in this setup).
Step 2: Create a Load Balancer
Go to Create a resource and search for Load Balancer.
Click on Create.
Fill in the required fields:
Subscription: Select your Azure subscription.
Resource Group: Use the same resource group where your VMs are located.
Name: Give your Load Balancer a name (e.g., MyLoadBalancer).
Region: Select the same region as your VMs.
Type: Choose Public if you want to balance traffic from the internet, or Internal for internal-only communication.
SKU: Select Standard.
Click Review + Create, then Create to deploy the Load Balancer.
Step 3: Configure the Backend Pool
After the Load Balancer is created, navigate to it in the Azure portal.
Under Settings, select Backend pools.
Click + Add to create a new backend pool.
Add the two VMs you created earlier into the backend pool.
Step 4: Configure Health Probes
Under Settings, select Health probes.
Click + Add to create a health probe.
Name: Give the probe a name (e.g., HTTPProbe).
Protocol: Select TCP or HTTP (depending on your application).
Port: Select a port (e.g., 80 for HTTP).
Interval: Set the probe interval (default 5 seconds).
Unhealthy threshold: Set how many failed probes are allowed before considering a VM as unhealthy (default 2).
Click OK to create the health probe.
Step 5: Configure Load Balancing Rules
Under Settings, select Load balancing rules.
Click + Add to create a new rule.
Fill in the required fields:
Name: Give your rule a name (e.g., HTTP-Rule).
Frontend IP configuration: Select the frontend IP address (this will be the public IP if it's a public load balancer).
Backend pool: Select the backend pool you created earlier.
Health probe: Select the health probe you created.
Protocol: Choose TCP or UDP, based on your application.
Port: Set the port to 80 (or your application’s port).
Session persistence: Leave as None (you can configure it later if needed).
Click OK to create the load balancing rule.
Step 6: Test the Load Balancer
Once everything is configured, navigate to the Frontend IP section of your Load Balancer.
Copy the Public IP address (for a public load balancer).
Open a web browser and navigate to the public IP.
If using HTTP (Port 80), you should see a response from one of the VMs in the backend pool.
Refresh the page several times to ensure the traffic is being load balanced between the two VMs.
You can verify this by checking the VM’s logs or the web server on each VM.
Step 7: Verify and Commit
Verify that the load balancing is working by ensuring traffic is distributed across the VMs.
Once everything is working, commit your setup to your Git repository. Create a folder named Task 7 and add any configuration files or scripts you used.

Please note i have all my resources which was done in previous task so, help me if i can use them or modify them as per the new task.

You can definitely use the resources you've already created in the previous tasks for this Load Balancer setup, making modifications where necessary. Here's how to adapt your previous resources for Task 7:

Step-by-Step Instructions:
1. Use Existing Virtual Machines (VMs) for the Backend Pool:
Since you've already created two Windows Server VMs in Task 4 (or earlier tasks), you can reuse these for the backend pool.
Go to Virtual Machines in the Azure portal.
Ensure both VMs are in the same VNet and subnet (as previously configured in Task 4).
You can either keep the existing dynamic IPs or assign static IPs to them for consistency in the backend pool configuration.
2. Create a Load Balancer:
Follow the steps mentioned in Task 7 to create the Load Balancer.
Since you've already created VMs, the Load Balancer should be in the same region as the VMs (from Task 4).
Choose the Standard SKU for the Load Balancer, as this works well with backend pools and health probes.
3. Modify the Backend Pool:
Go to your Load Balancer.
Under Settings, select Backend pools.
Edit the backend pool to include the two existing VMs that you created earlier.
Choose Add a backend pool and select your VMs from the list of available virtual machines.
This will ensure that your Load Balancer can route traffic to these VMs.
4. Set Up the Health Probes:
Create a health probe as described in the original steps (either HTTP or TCP).
Ensure that the health probe checks an active port on your VMs (for example, port 80 for a web server).
This will allow the Load Balancer to check the health of the VMs and route traffic only to healthy ones.
5. Modify the Load Balancing Rules:
Create the necessary load balancing rules based on your application requirements (port 80 for HTTP or other application ports).
Set the frontend IP configuration to the existing IP you want the Load Balancer to use.
Ensure that the backend pool is updated to reflect the two VMs you want to load balance across.
6. Verify and Test the Load Balancer:
Test the Load Balancer using the public IP you have assigned (if you're using a public load balancer).
Ensure traffic is being evenly distributed across both VMs.
Refresh and observe the distribution of traffic to confirm that the load balancing is working.
Summary of Changes:
Virtual Machines: Reuse the VMs from Task 4 or Task 2 as backend pool members.
Network Security Group (NSG): If your existing NSG is configured to allow traffic on the relevant ports (like port 80 for HTTP), no changes are needed here.
Route Table: No changes needed, as the VMs are already in the same VNet and subnet.
Let me know if you need help with any part of this setup, and we'll proceed with the next task afterward!
